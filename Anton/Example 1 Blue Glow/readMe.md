Start the program by opening the index.html file.

This is a simple program created in sketch.js created by Justin Windle: https://github.com/soulwire/sketch.js, a creative coding framework. This program is built on an existing example from codepen by Nate Wiley: https://codepen.io/natewiley/pen/yYBxey

In the original example, the user gets to play around with particles that stem from the cursor. In my example, the user gets to decide when to spawn particles using the mouse. Try to have some fun and mess around with this program using the mouse!

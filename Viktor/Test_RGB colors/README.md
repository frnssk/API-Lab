This is a animation created using the sketch.js API library created by Justin Windle: https://github.com/soulwire/sketch.js, a creative coding framework. This animation is built on an existing example found on codepen by Theun: https://codepen.io/tjoen/pen/qdbpOp
In the original example created by Theun, the user can move the mouse around which makes the background color of the page change. In my example I played around with the different RGB colors to get another result.

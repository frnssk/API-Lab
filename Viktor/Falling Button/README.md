In the original example, the user can play a game costisting of 
left moving platforms and a box that jumps when one of the 
assigned keyboard keys or left mousebutton is pressed. 
In this example the user can press a button which then falls using 
the same animation as the box in the original.

To start the program open the index.html file in your browser.

This is a animation created using the sketch.js API library created by Justin Windle: https://github.com/soulwire/sketch.js,
a creative coding framework. 
This animation is built on an existing example found on codepen by Eduardo Lopes: https://codepen.io/EduardoLopes/pen/IJnAr

In the original example created by Lopes, the user can play a game costisting of left moving platforms and a box that jumps when one of the 
assigned keyboard keys or left mousebutton is pressed. 
In this example the user can press a button which then falls using 
the same animation as the box in the original.

## Crawling lasher

This program creates a set of tentacles that are based on a few points in a line which a curve is drawn between. The tentacles are attached to a point on one end and are hanging loose on the other. The point can be set to either follow the mouse or to fly around randomly on the display. 
In the beginning of the code there are a few settings that can easily be altered to change the behaviour of the tentacles, you may add wind or gravity, for example. 

The example simulates tentacles that will interact with their enviroment. It shows in what ways you can use sketch.js to simulate an environment in a way that allows objects that you put into it to interact with it. 

Start the program by opening index.html in your browser of choice.

# Blob Colour cascade

This is a simple program that will create an array of dots that are falling from the top of the screen to the bottom. In the program there are several settings that can be played with the alter the behaviour of the dots. 

This Example shows how sketch.js's particle handling cane be used to create an environment that, in this case, is used in a very basic game. 
The example is used as an implementation prototype. By implementing the particles falling into the game you could easily make Blob interact with the raindrops, or have the raindrops interact with the environment. 

To start the program, open index.html in your browser of choice. 
You can control Blob with W, A, S & D on your keyboard.

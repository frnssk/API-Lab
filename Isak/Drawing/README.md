#Drawing

An easy application that let's the user draw with the mouse. Optimal for a touch screen
as it detects multi-touch. For each finger added to the screen a new color is generated. 
This can be used for easy painting applications. 

##Running

Open the index.html file is a browser of choice to be able to use the application.

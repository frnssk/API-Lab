# API-Lab Project Group 9
This repository is the API-lab group work of group 9 of the first year interaction design class at Malmö university. In this project, we explored the different capabilities of the Sketch.js JavaScript library and how it might benefit when an interaction designer is working with implementation prototyping.

The project is useful for fast vector-based animation/gaming prototypes and the API uses a simple loop to create animations.

The user can either download the API from their GitHub:
https://soulwire.github.io/sketch.js/
Or use a CDN.

By opening the mainPage/index.html you can see and test all the different examples that were presented.

# About

This is an application that expands on the code created by Nate Wiley. The application will create animated squares on mouse click that changes color and if you hover them with your cursor the animated squares will disappear.

The example is used as an implementation prototype to explore how the library can be used in the context of providing feedforward.

To start the program, open index.html in your browser of choice.
